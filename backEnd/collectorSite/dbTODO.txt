when clicking on products, load a JSON object with all the objects, like an API

In the products model, have: 
    picture 
    title
    price
    condition
    seller info
    availability
    return policy?

IN OTHER WORDS:
1. figure out database stuff and have a product model with the attributes above
2. figure out how to return a JSON object when you go to the /products route, like an API

As far as inserting web scraper stuff into SQLite:
    can have webscraper return HTML 

TO INITALIZE THE SITE.DB FILE MANUALLY VIA THE CMDLINE:
    cd backEnd
    python
    from collectorSite import db
    db.create_all()
    from collectorSite.models import Product
    product_1 = Product(title='Keyboard', price = 100, condition = 'new')
    db.session.add(product_1)
    product_2 = Product(title='Shoes', price = 200, condition = 'new')
    db.session.add(product_2)
    db.session.commit()
    
This should create the site.db file.

To later access all the products, you can then use SQLAlchemy commands like
    cd backEnd
    python
    from collectorSite import db
    from collectorSite.models import Product
    Product.query.all()
    (idk how to get them to show up on the webpage yet)
