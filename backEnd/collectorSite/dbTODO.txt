when clicking on products, load a JSON object with all the objects, like an API

In the products model, have: 
    picture 
    title
    price
    condition
    seller info
    availability
    return policy?

IN OTHER WORDS:
1. figure out database stuff and have a product model with the attributes above
2. figure out how to return a JSON object when you go to the /products route, like an API

As far as inserting web scraper stuff into SQLite:
    can have webscraper return HTML 

FOR EACH PRODUCT, THE WEBSCRAPER RETURNS A DICTIONARY OF EACH OF ITS ATTRIBUTES
