The webscraper returns a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains
 the name, price, picture, condition, seller info, availability, and return policy
 of each item on the page. Create an object using PageParser and pass the URL as its
 argument. The URL should be like this https://www.ebay.com/b/Collectible-Funko-Bobbleheads-1970-Now/149372/bn_3017826
 Then call the .parse_all() method on it.
