when clicking on products, load a JSON object with all the objects, like an API

In the products model, have: 
    picture 
    title
    price
    condition
    seller info
    availability
    return policy?

IN OTHER WORDS:
1. figure out database stuff and have a product model with the attributes above
2. figure out how to return a JSON object when you go to the /products route, like an API

As far as inserting web scraper stuff into SQLite:
    can have webscraper return HTML 

TO INITALIZE THE SITE.DB FILE MANUALLY VIA THE CMDLINE:
    cd backEnd
    python
    from app import db
    db.create_all()
    from app import Product
    product_1 = Product(title='Keyboard', price = 100, condition = 'new')
    db.session.add(product_1)
    product_2 = Product(title='Shoes', price = 200, condition = 'new')
    db.session.add(product_2)
    db.session.commit()
    
    This should create the site.db file. You can then query the products
    (idk how to get them to show up on the webpage yet)

    use db.drop_all() to create all the tables and rows
